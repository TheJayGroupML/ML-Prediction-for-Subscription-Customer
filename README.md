ML with TensorFlow: This is valuable to companies like Pandora or Amazon that offer free and monthly/yearly subscreiptions to services and deliveries.

### Highlights

* This model can identify the most important metrics for a customer to come back again on subscription. 

### BYOD: Bring Your Own Data!

* This is highly dependant on having a lot of the right data to achieve >90% accuracy.
* You may need to tweak hyperparams and some code to fit your data properly, but it does work.
